# lokalize
# The code was written as part of the Lokalize take home tests
# by Chidozie Onwuakaludike


#########################################


# The code was written in PHP
# It simply connects to the exchangeratesapi.io API endpoint to retrieve the exchange rate for 2010-01-15 
# it then renders the information received in JSON into a HTML table.

# To run this script, you would need to run the PHP file on a web server with PHP installed 
# OR
# a development environment that supports PHP (example wampserver) can be used on a local machine.

# Alternatively, You can copy,paste  and run the script into https://paiza.io/en after choosing PHP as the preferred language

# Thank you
